# How We Moderate, and How We Build Structure for a Kind Community

## Goal

Moderation exists to protect the conditions that make FanHearth worth being in: a place where people can be authentically themselves, love the things they love without embarrassment, and form real friendships. Bad moderation — or no moderation — destroys exactly that.

## Community Culture & Norms

FanHearth has a culture of gentle correction, not punishment. When something doesn't fit, the community response is a kind redirect: "hey, we don't kink shame here" or "it's ok if you didn't like the fic, just move on — let others enjoy it."

**What belongs here:**
- Original fan content (art, fic, edits, head canons, analysis)
- Sharing and discussing others' fan work (with attribution)
- Personal life — bad days, good days, crises, celebrations. Real friendships form here, and that requires space for real life.
- Celebrating the public work of artists, actors, directors, authors — interviews, photoshoots, public appearances
- Respectful disagreement that engages with what the person actually said

**What doesn't belong:**
- Speculating about or prying into the private lives of public figures
- Bad-faith engagement: sea lioning, derailing, dismissing people's lived experience to push a political agenda
- Harassment, dogpiling, or coordinated targeting of users

## Structural Choices

**Politics is not a top-level topic.** It won't appear in the topics list and isn't browsable. You can only encounter it in the feed of someone you follow.

This is intentional. The personal is political — you can't talk about loving gay hockey romance novels without sometimes touching on why no NHL players are out, or talk about your life as a trans person without sometimes talking about Kansas deactivating trans drivers licenses with no notice. That's fine and belongs here. But FanHearth isn't primarily an organizing space, and making politics a browsable topic would pull it in that direction.

## What We're Actively Preventing

These are patterns that have destroyed other online communities. We're designing explicitly against them:

- **Double standards in moderation** — rules must apply equally regardless of which group is involved. A behavior that's acceptable for one community member must be acceptable for all.
- **Dehumanizing language and slurs** — zero tolerance
- **Harassment and dogpiling** — coordinated pile-ons are a moderation failure, not a community disagreement
- **Moderator complicity** — moderators who agree with or enable discriminatory behavior are the problem, not the solution
- **Political content bleeding into every space** — structural choices (no politics as a top-level topic) exist to prevent this
- **Making targeted groups responsible for managing their harassers** — this inverts what safety means

## Zero Tolerance

- No realistic images, photographs, videos, or AI-generated realistic images depicting child sexual abuse, rape, murder, or assault. Content which is illegal in the state of California is not allowed.
Fictional written content including mature or offensive themes, is allowed — [AO3's approach](https://www.transformativeworks.org/tos-spotlight-offensive-content/) is our north star until we have a full offensive content policy.

## Mistakes and Repair

We will make mistakes. Assuming things will go right the first time is a recipe for failure — for moderators, for community members, and for the platform itself. What matters is the repair: understanding what went wrong, taking it seriously, and fixing it. A culture of accountability means mistakes are expected and addressed, not hidden or punished into silence.

This applies at every level: individual community members getting things wrong, moderators making bad calls, and platform-level decisions that turn out to be misguided. The goal isn't perfection. The goal is a community that can see when something went wrong and actually do something about it.

## Open Questions

- What do the actual moderation and correction mechanisms look like in practice?
- How do we handle edge cases and gray areas?
- How do we learn from 20+ years of internet community building without reinventing the wheel? (Trust & Safety best practices, what worked and failed on LiveJournal, Tumblr, forums, Discord, etc.)
- If we can't build the culture we want, do we shut it down rather than let it turn toxic?
