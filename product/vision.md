# Vision

It's gonna be a site for fandom community. A place for sharing fan edits, links to fanfic on Ao3, gifs,
talking about fandom, and making friends. I'm tired of Internet 2.0. It sucks. We're going back to 1.0. FanHearth.net is an old school community. We're
gonna be run by fans, for fans. A place to make friends, have fun, and enforce the social contract of being good fans. A place that's slightly unhinged
in the best way. A place where you don't have to be your online self that your job can find, but instead, your fandom alt, where you let your freak flag
 fly. Basically anything fandom related goes, outside of a small set of rules (which we will decide on, but will include no parasocial weirdness, no
unauthorized/paparazzi photos, no AI, no editing real people onto nudes that aren't theirs, no sexual images of kids, and no nazi hate. that's probably
about it, but we'll come back to that and detail it later.)
