# Culture

## Our guiding principle
If we don't succeed in creating the culture we want, and it starts to turn toxic, we'll shut it all down, rather than let it become a toxic cesspool.

Some basic cultural rules:
- Engage with what the person actually said. Don't derail to your own political agenda. No sea lioning.
- Be kind. Remember you're talking to humans.

# North star
Be Kind. Do the right thing. Do what works.

A health, kind, fandom community where people of all races, ethnicities, religions, countries, sexual identity, genders, feel safe to discuss and contribute to fandom and fan works.

This is fandom. Your freak flag is welcome to fly, except where it harms another person. Your right to swing your fist stops at my face.

We will build a good code of conduct, probably based on https://github.com/gembarrett/coconduct-builder before we launch.
