# Working on FanHearth

## What is FanHearth?
FanHearth.net is an old-school, fan-run community site. A return to Internet 1.0 values - authentic, slightly unhinged (in the best way), and run by fans for fans.

See `product/vision.md` for the full vision.

## Development Philosophy
1. Define MVP carefully (both tech AND culture)
2. Vibecode it fast
3. Build a real community
4. Learn what works
5. Rebuild properly, piece by piece, under the functioning community

See `product/roadmap.md` for phases.

## Important Guidelines

### No AI-Generated Content
This is a core value of FanHearth. It extends to this codebase:
- **DO NOT** write vision, culture, or product documents without asking first
- The human writes those docs - they need to be human-authored
- You can help with ideation, discussion, and later UI design and coding
- When in doubt, ask before writing

### Working Together
- Help with thinking through ideas
- Answer questions
- Discuss structure and approaches
- Write code when directed (in Phase 3+)
- Create placeholders when asked
- Always ask before writing substantial content

## Project Structure
- `product/` - Vision, culture, roadmap, and other product docs (human-written)
- `src/` - Code (comes later)

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Foundation - defining vision, culture, and MVP scope
